# Netflix-Data-Analysis-Unified-Mentor
This project explores a Netflix dataset using Python to understand how content is distributed across genres, countries, ratings, and years.
I focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling to uncover insights about Netflix’s content strategy.

# 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze Netflix’s catalog and answer key questions such as:

- What is the balance between Movies and TV Shows?

- How has Netflix’s content library grown over the years?

- Which genres dominate the platform?

- Which countries produce the most Netflix titles?

- What does the ratings distribution look like?

- How long are most Netflix movies on average?

- Who are the top contributing directors?

This project helped me practice data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and deriving insights from real-world data.

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
*Steps performed before analysis:*

- Removed missing, null, and inconsistent values

- Normalized placeholders like "Not Given"

- Converted date columns into usable datetime format

- Split genre and country columns into lists for analysis

- Extracted numerical duration values from strings

- Created derived fields like duration_min and year_added

- Standardized column names for consistency

These steps ensured that the dataset was clean and analysis-ready.

# Key Insights:
Netflix’s catalog is dominated by Movies, but TV Shows have shown consistent growth over the years.

Dramatically increased content additions between 2016–2019 reflect Netflix’s global expansion phase.

Drama, International Movies, and Documentaries are among the top genres.

The United States and India are the highest content-producing countries.

TV-MA, TV-14, and PG-13 ratings appear the most — showing a strong presence of mature-themed content.

Most movies fall within a runtime of 80–120 minutes, with documentaries often forming the longer-duration outliers.
