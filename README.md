# Netflix-Data-Analysis-Unified-Mentor
This project explores a Netflix dataset using Python to understand how content is distributed across genres, countries, ratings, and years.
I focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling to uncover insights about Netflix’s content strategy.

# 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze Netflix’s catalog and answer key questions such as:

- What is the balance between Movies and TV Shows?

- How has Netflix’s content library grown over the years?

- Which genres dominate the platform?

- Which countries produce the most Netflix titles?

- What does the ratings distribution look like?

- How long are most Netflix movies on average?

- Who are the top contributing directors?

This project helped me practice data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and deriving insights from real-world data.
